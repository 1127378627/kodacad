  <h1>Tutorial: Creating the Classic OCC Bottle</h1>

  <h3>Create a New Workplane</h3>

  <p>In the menubar, click on <b>Workplane</b> then <b>At Origin, XY Plane</b>.</p>

	<img src="images/wp1.png" width="805" height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <p><b>wp1</b> is created in the X-Y plane of the global coordinate system. It is
  <b>Active</b> (as signified by the green background color in tree view). Also notice
  that a pair of construction lines has been created. One <b>horizontal</b> and one
  <b>vertical</b>. They intersect at a point (shown as a yellow '+' symbol) which is
  located at the workplane's (u=0, v=0) coordinates. Every workplane will have its own
  (u, v, w) local coordinate system. If you think of the workplane as being represented
  by a sheet of paper laying on a table in front of you, u is the horizontal direction to
  the right, v is the vertical direction away from you, and w is the direction normal to
  the paper (out of the table).</p><img src="images/wp2.png" width="805" height="521"

  <p>Now zoom in using one of these techniques:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>MMB scroll wheel</li>

    <li>Ctrl+RMB</li>

    <li>RMB</li>

    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Draw</li>

        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
          <ul>
            <li>Fit All</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><img src="images/wp3.png" width="805" height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <h3>Draw construction lines</h3>

  <p>Click on top-most toolbar button (Horizontal Construction line), then Enter
  <b>30</b> into the <b>User Input</b> widget.</p><img src="images/wp4.png" width="805"
  height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <p>Draw 5 more construction lines at the following values: 15, 7.5, -7.5, -15, -30 and
  zoom in a bit more.</p><img src="images/wp5.png" width="805" height="521" border="0"
  alt="" />

  <h3>Draw construction circles</h3>

  <p>Click on "construction circe" toolbar button, then click on the point at 0, 30
  (center of circle), then point at 0, -15.</p><img src="images/wp6.png" width="805"
  height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <p>Draw a second construction circle by first entering the coordinates of its center
  (0,-30) but without the parentheses, then enter the value 45 for the radius.</p>

  <p>In general, when a 2d point is needed, you have the option of either clicking on a
  point or entering the point coordinates in the <b>User Input</b> widget. When in doubt,
  check the status bar in the lower left corner to find out what data is expected
  next.</p><img src="images/wp7.png" width="805" height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <h3>Draw the Profile</h3>

  <p>Click on the (blue) <b>line</b> toolbar button and then add two lines as shown by
  clicking on the end points. Next, use the <b>Arc by3Pts</b> tool to create two arcs.
  (Clicking order is end, mid, end.) The profile is now complete. It needs to be a closed
  loop, otherwise the next step won't work.</p><img src="images/wp8.png" width="805"
  height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <h3>Extrude the Bottle</h3>

  <p>In the menubar, click on <b>Create 3D</b> then <b>Extrude</b>. Enter <b>70</b> for
  the extrusion distance and enter <b>Bottle</b> for the name.</p>

  <p>The new part <b>Bottle</b> is now displayed in both the 3D Display window and in the
  Tree View widget. Notice also that the Tree View shows <b>Bottle</b> highlighted in
  yellow, signifying that this is the <b>Active part</b>. It is important to remember
  which part is active, because any subsequent modifications will be carried out on the
  Active part.</p><img src="images/bot1.png" width="805" height="521" border="0" alt=
  "" />

  <h3>Blend (fillet) the edges of the Bottle</h3>

  <p>Hide wp1 from the display widow by unchecking its checkbox in the Tree View. This is
  done to make sure that we don't accidentally select profile lines in the next step.</p>

  <p>In the menubar, click on <b>Modify Active Part</b> then <b>Fillet</b>. Carefully
  select all 12 edges (one by one) of the <b>Bottle</b>. (I know this is a pain. Box
  select would be really handy, but it's not implemented yet.) Enter the fillet radius
  value of <b>3</b>.</p>

  <p>A new <b>Bottle</b> part (with the same name) has been created and made active. The
  old part is still there but blanked from view (and no longer active). The old part is
  an <b>Ancestor</b> of the new part.</p><img src="images/bot2.png" width="805" height=
  "521" border="0" alt="" />

  <h3>Create the neck</h3>

  <p>In the menubar, click on <b>Workpane</b> then <b>On face</b>. Select the top face of
  the bottle. (The face normal will be the <b>w direction</b> of the new workplane.) Now
  select one of the flat side faces. (The face normal will be the <b>u direction</b> of
  the new workplane.) A new workplane <b>w2</b> is now be created (and is active). Its
  0,0 coordinates are located at the center of the bottle's top face.</p>

  <p>Next, make a Profile circle on <b>w2</b> with center at 0,0 and radius = 7.5.</p>

  <p>Now click on <b>Create 3D</b> then <b>Extrude</b>. Enter <b>7</b> for the extrusion
  distance and enter <b>Neck</b> for the name.</p>

  <p>The Neck is created and is now the <b>active part</b>.</p><img src="images/bot3.png"
  width="805" height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <h3>Fuse the Neck to the Bottle</h3>

  <p>In the Tree View, hide wp2 by unchecking its box. We no longer need to see that. Now
  left click on the most recently created <b>Bottle</b> (still with a check mark), then
  right click and select <b>Set Active</b>. By setting the Bottle active, we can fuse the
  Neck to the Bottle rather than the other way around.</p>

  <p>Now click on <b>Modify Active Part</b> then <b>Fuse</b>. Click on the Neck in the
  <b>3D Display</b> window. (Clicking the Neck in the Tree View window won't work
  (yet).)</p>

  <p>A new <b>Bottle</b> is now created and is set active. Uncheck the check box of the
  Neck. We don't need to see that any longer.</p><img src="images/bot4.png" width="805"
  height="521" border="0" alt="" />

  <h3>Shell the Bottle</h3>

  <p>Just for fun, try filleting the base of the neck with a radius value of <b>2</b>
  before shelling.</p>

  <p>Now in the menubar, click on <b>Modify Active Part</b> then <b>Shell</b>. Click
  first on the top circular face of the bottle, then enter a shell thickness of
  <b>1</b>.</p>

  <p>The final <b>Bottle</b> is comlete.</p><img src="images/bot5.png" width="805"
